# IUSS_INGV_REPO README 

Git project to track the work related to the use of ML for tsunami onshore hazard prediction as a surrogate model which can be linked with a regional offshore tsunami model that can be used as the input by providing offshore wave amplitude as timeseries.

Simulation data for training the ML model provided by INGV for Eastern Scicily with inundation focused on Catania and Siracusa for 1212 events,check below html maps for quick view of events and data:
